WARNING: Note that this integration inherently escalates anyone with push permissions to the admin role, since they can push config settings to the master branch, which will be synced. In the future, we may add restrictions to allow changes to the config file to be merged only by specific people/teams, or those with admin access (via a combination of protected branches, required statuses, and branch restrictions). Until then, use caution when merging PRs and adding collaborators.

This integration is open source. Check out probot/settings to suggest improvements or run your own instance.
